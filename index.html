	<h2>Mini Schnauzer Trivia</h2>
	<p>You may or may not have heard about the canine breed Schnauzer.  One thing for sure if once you see them you won't have trouble recognizing them in the future.  With their distinctive features they tend to stick out in a crowd.  They have hair not fur and can be seen with a variety of haircuts.  In particular their sometimes bushy eyebrows and beard make them quite easy to distinguish.  Let's look at a few interesting facts and tidbits about the breed.
	</p>
	<p>Here are some interesting trivia about the Schnauzer breed that you might find interesting.  The famous Schnauzer mustache was due to their use as "ratters"as they were  originally bred by German farmers to protect the farm and chase rats.  There are three types of Schnauzers: giant, standard, and miniature.  The giant type was also a farm dog but was bred to hard and drive cattle to market.  Schnauzer is derived from the German word schnauze which translates to snout in English.  The Schnauzer is known for its distinctive snout with its mustache.
